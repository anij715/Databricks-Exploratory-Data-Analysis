#Exploratory Data Analysis using Databricks

## üìù Description

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset using the Databricks platform. The primary goal of EDA is to summarize the main characteristics of a dataset, often employing data visualization methods. It's a critical first step in any data science workflow, helping to understand the data, identify anomalies, uncover patterns, and formulate hypotheses before diving into more complex modeling.

This repository contains a Databricks archive (`.dbc`) file, which includes the notebook with the complete analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Platform:** Databricks
* **Core Engine:** Apache Spark
* **Language:** Python
* **Key Libraries:**
    * PySpark (for data manipulation and analysis at scale)
    * Pandas (for smaller-scale data manipulation)
    * Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)
    * Databricks `display()` function

## üéØ Project Objectives

The main objectives of this exploratory analysis are to:

1.  **Load and Inspect:** Load the dataset into a Spark DataFrame and examine its basic structure, schema, and data types.
2.  **Data Cleaning:** Identify and handle any missing values, duplicates, or inconsistencies in the data.
3.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical features.
4.  **Univariate Analysis:** Analyze individual variables to understand their distribution (e.g., using histograms, box plots).
5.  **Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis:** Investigate the relationships between different variables (e.g., using scatter plots, correlation matrices, heatmaps).
6.  **Derive Insights:** Document key findings and observations from the analysis that could inform future feature engineering and model building.

## üöÄ How to Use

This project is packaged as a Databricks Archive (`.dbc`) file. To use it, you need to import it into your Databricks workspace.

### Prerequisites

* An active Databricks account/workspace.
* A running cluster to attach the notebook to.

### Import Instructions

1.  Log in to your Databricks workspace.
2.  Navigate to the Workspace folder where you want to import the project.
3.  Click on the **three dots** (or chevron) next to the folder name and select **Import**.
    4.  In the dialog box, drag and drop or browse to the `Exploratory_Data_Analysis_using_Databricks (1).dbc` file.
5.  Click the **Import** button.
6.  The notebook and any associated files will now be available in your workspace. You can open the notebook, attach it to a cluster, and run the cells.
